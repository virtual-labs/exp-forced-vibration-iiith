Forced vibration is of two types: <br>
1. undamped forced vibration<br>
2. damped forced vibration <br>
Undamped forced vibration : The differential governing equation for system without damping is mü + ku = posinωt<br>
where, m = mass; ü = acceleration; k = stiffness; u = displacement; ωn= natural frequency; po= amplitude of force.<br>
Solution of the given equation is <br>
