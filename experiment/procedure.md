**Observation 1:** Effect of time period on maximum response

1. Run the experiment with default building parameters.
2. Observe the response and note down the maximum response.
3. Repeat the experiment by changing the values of mass and stiffness of the structure. (Note: Change in these values will change the time period of the structure)
4. Note the maximum response.
5. Plot the graph between the maximum response and the time period of the structure.

**Observation 2:** Effect of resonance without damping

1. Set the vibration frequency to the same as that of the structure(calculated using mass and stiffness) to observe resonance. Also set damping to 0. 
2. Run the experiment and note the maximum displacement.
3. Response value increases and reaches peak when vibration frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure.
4. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio.

**Observation 3:** Effect of resonance with damping

1. Set the vibration frequency to the same as that of the structure(calculated using mass and stiffness) to observe resonance. Also set damping to appropriate value. 
2. Run the experiment and note the maximum displacement.
3. Response value increases and reaches peak when vibration frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure even with damping.
4. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio.
