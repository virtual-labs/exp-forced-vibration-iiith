**Observation 1:** Effect of time period on maximum response

1. Run the experiment with default building parameters.
2. Observe the response and note down the maximum response.
3. Repeat the experiment by changing the values of mass and stiffness of the structure. (Note: Change in these values will change the time period of the structure)
4. Note the maximum response.
5. Plot the graph between the maximum response and the time period of the structure and compare with given graph. Note that the red dot represents the current simulation values as per the inputs given.

**Observation 2:** Effect of resonance without damping

1. Set the vibration frequency to the same as that of the structure(calculated using mass and stiffness) to observe resonance. Also set damping to 0. 
2. Run the experiment and note the maximum displacement.
3. Response value increases and reaches peak when vibration frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure.
4. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio and compare with given graph. Note that the red dot represents the current simulation values as per the inputs given.

**Observation 3:** Effect of resonance with damping

1. Set the vibration frequency to the same as that of the structure(calculated using mass and stiffness) to observe resonance. Also set damping to appropriate value. 
2. Run the experiment and note the maximum displacement.
3. Response value increases and reaches peak when vibration frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure even with damping.
4. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio and compare with given graph. Note that the red dot represents the current simulation values as per the inputs given.

**Graphs**

1. There are various features available for the graphs such as zoom, etc. The function/feature of each icon above the graphs becomes visible upon hovering over the concerned icon.
