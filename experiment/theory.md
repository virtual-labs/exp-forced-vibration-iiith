Forced vibration is of two types:
1. undamped forced vibration
2. damped forced vibration
Undamped forced vibration : The differential governing equation for system without damping is mü + ku = posinωt
where, m = mass; ü = acceleration; k = stiffness; u = displacement; ωn= natural frequency; po= amplitude of force.
Solution of the given equation is
