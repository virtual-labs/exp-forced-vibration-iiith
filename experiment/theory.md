Forced vibration is of two types:
1. undamped forced vibration
2. damped forced vibration
Undamped forced vibration : The differential governing equation for system without damping is m¨¹ + ku = posin¦Øt
where, m = mass; ¨¹ = acceleration; k = stiffness; u = displacement; ¦Øn= natural frequency; po= amplitude of force.
Solution of the given equation is
